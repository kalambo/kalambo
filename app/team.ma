              Jon
                Whitehead,
              "
              Jon is passionate about empowering people to achieve more with their time, skills and resources - especially people working to make positive change in the world. In the process of developing technical solutions for a range of small to medium sized charities, he created a new language for building data-driven tools and interfaces, and in 2017 founded Kalambo to put this new technology to good use. Outside of work he loves a hearty philosophical chat, and recently discovered the joy of cycle touring.

              "
              Vicky is a data scientist and loves using data as a way to help individuals and organisations make better decisions. She was previously an economist, helping to evaluate multimillion pound charity programmes and policies, and also set up and ran a charity to help reduce youth unemployment. She takes care of Kalambo’s operations, and is cooking up some impact evaluation modules to give small charities affordable access to state-of-the-art impact evaluation! She also runs and cycles.

              Nick
                Howley,
              "
              Nick is Kalambo’s marketing department and design expert, bringing his experience of managing communications for a national mental health charity and a social care start-up. Having worked in a number of organisations limited by frustrating software, he’s excited to get the chance to make user-friendly apps with Kalambo, and push the boundaries of what charities can do. Outside work he’s a keen swimmer and pianist. While on holiday he likes to stir up tension between family members then make documentaries about it.
